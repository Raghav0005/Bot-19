## Inspiration: 
  Moving from discord to a web browser could be annoy and costs time. Especially if you have very little time.
  We wanted to create something that could provide important information fast without the need of opening a web-browser or 
  visiting some sort of sketchy statistics website.
  
  BOT-19 was designed to provide exactly that; fast and accurate information on the fly with simple commands. This discord bot
  uses APIs for COVID-19 statistics as well as News sources to extract data without requiring the user to visit these sites.

## What it does:
  BOT-19 provides a range of data: COVID-19 statistics for the entire world, for specific countries, or even specific Canadian provinces. 
  In addition, it has a news/headline command that provides headline news on any topic of the user's choice. 
  On top of that, the bot can also visualize COVID-19 data with a graph for easier communication as well as screen the user for COVID-19.
  
## Future Aspirations:
  We would like to expand our news databases so we cover a wider range of topics.
  We want to create a more friendly user interface, and transition screening into a DM chat instead of in-server
  Furthermore, we want to have more functions such as comparing two countries.
